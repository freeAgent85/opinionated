The purpose of this addon is to inform you when a link location is an opinion article. Most popular news sites have opinion blogs, and you don't want to confuse those articles with reporting articles. The addon will add "[OPINIONATED]" to the text content of every identified URL that links to an opinion article.

Alternatively if an opinion article is not linked, this addon will use a curated list from https://www.allsides.com to indicate the bias of a new source:

1. "[<<]" = Left
1. "[<]"  = Lean Left
1. "[<>]" = Center
1. "[>]"  = Lean Right
1. "[>>]" = Right
